Solapex: Rooftop Solar Potential Analysis
A project developed in collaboration with ISRO for optimized solar panel placement.

🛰️ Project Overview
Solapex is an open-source tool designed to automate the calculation of available "free area" on rooftops using satellite or aerial imagery. By identifying obstructions (chimneys, water tanks, AC units) and calculating usable surface area, Solapex helps users determine the maximum number of solar panels a roof can accommodate.

✨ Key Features
Automatic Roof Segmentation: Identifies roof boundaries from top-down imagery.

Obstruction Detection: Filters out non-usable areas like vents, skylights, and existing structures.

Irradiance Estimation: (Optional: include if your project calculates sun exposure).

Cost-Benefit Analysis: Estimates potential energy generation based on the calculated free area.**
